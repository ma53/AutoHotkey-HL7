; For a simple use case.  I've included in the Sample_HL7.txt file a header
; that I made up for Hackers.  Each "HAK" segment represents an individual hacker.

; individual components, and all their known aliases in the second field as
; individual components.

; We need the text of the HL7 file in memory in order to pass it to the parser
Fileread, HL7_Text, Sample_HL7.txt

; The sending application is located in a segment with the "MSH" header.  I expect

; Within that segment, it's the second field, first "repeat", first component,
; first sub-component.
Sending_Application := Parsed_HL7["MSH"][1][2][1][1][1]

; The event type code (which is normally used to identify the type of message
; being sent), is under the "EVN" header, first field.  I don't expect any
; extra repeats, components, or subcomponents, so those are all 1.
